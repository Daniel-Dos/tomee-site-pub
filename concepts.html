<p>OpenEJB was founded on the idea that it would be embedded into third-party
environments whom would likely already have three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>their one "server" platform with existing clients and protocols</li>
<li>their own way to configure their platform</li>
<li>existing services like TransactionManager, Security, and Connector</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus the focus of OpenEJB was to create an EJB implementation that would be
easily embeddible, configurable, and customizable.  </p>

<p>Part of achieving that is a drive to be as simple as possible as to not
over-define and therefore restrict the ability to be embeddible,
configurable and customizable.  Smaller third-party environments could
easily 'downscale' OpenEJB in their integrations by replacing standard
components with lighter implementations or removing them all together and
larger environments could 'upscale' OpenEJB by replacing and adding heavier
implementations of those standard components likely tailored to their
systems and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Container and Server are mentioned in the EJB spec as being separate things
but are never defined formally.  In our world Containers, which implement
the basic component contract and lifecycle of a bean are not coupled to any
particular Server, which has the job of providing a naming service and
providing a way for it's clients to reference and invoke components (beans)
hosted in Containers.  Because Containers have no dependence at all only
Server, you can run OpenEJB without any Server at all in an embedded
environment for example without any work or any extra overhead.  Similarly
you can add as many new Server components as you want without ever having
to modify any Containers.</p>

<p>There is a very strong pluggability focus in OpenEJB as it was always
intended to be embedded and customized in other environments.  As a result
all Containers are pluggable, isolated from each other, and no one
Container is bound to another Container and therefore removing or adding a
Container has no repercussions on the other Containers in the system. 
TransactionManager, SecurityService and Connector also pluggable and are
services exposed to Containers.  A Container may not be dependent on
specific implementations of those services.  Service Providers define what
services they are offering (Container, Connector, Security, Transaction,
etc.) in a file they place in their jar called service-jar.xml.  </p>

<p>The service-jar.xml should be placed not in the META-INF but somewhere in
your package hierarchy (ours is in /org/apache/openejb/service-jar.xml)
which allows the services in your service-jar.xml to be referenced by name
(such as DefaultStatefulContainer) or more specifically by package and id
(such as org.apache.openejb#DefaultStatefulContainer).  </p>

<p>The same implementation of a service can be declared several times in a
service-jar.xml with different ids.  This allows for you to setup several
several different profiles or pre-configured versions of the services you
provide each with a different name and different set of default values for
its properties.  </p>

<p>In your openejb.conf file when you declare Containers and Connectors, we
are actually hooking you up with Service Providers automatically.  You get
what is in the org/apache/openejb/service-jar.xml by default, but you are
able to point specifically to a specific Service Provider by the 'provider'
attribute on the Container, Connector, TransactionManager, SecurityService,
etc. elements of the openejb.conf file.  When you declare a service
(Container, Connector, etc.) in your openejb.conf file the properties you
supply override the properties supplied by the Service Provider, thus you
only need to specify the properties you'd like to change and can have your
openejb.conf file as large or as small as you would like it.  The act of
doing this can be thought of as essentially instantiating the Service
Provider and configuring that instance for inclusion in the runtime system. </p>

<p>For example Container(id=NoTimeoutStatefulContainer,
provider=DefaultStatefulContainer) could be declared with it's Timeout
property set to 0 for never, and a
Container(id=ShortTimeoutStatefulContainer,
provider=DefaultStatefulContainer) could be declared with it's Timeout
property set to 15 minutes.  Both would be instances of the
DefaultStatefulContainer Service Provider which is a service of type
Container.</p>
